## Business Case
The executive team observed a concerning trend in **inventory turnover ratio**, impacting storage costs and profitability. The current **average ratio is 5.35**, compared to the **industry benchmark of 8**. This analysis investigates quarterly trends and provides actionable insights.

## Key Findings
- Q1 (2.79) and Q2 (3.64) showed **weak inventory movement**, far below industry standards.
- Q3 (8.68) briefly exceeded the benchmark, suggesting demand can be captured with better planning.
- Q4 (6.28) improved but still fell short of the target.
- Overall **average = 5.35**, significantly lower than **target = 8**.

## Business Implications
- **Excess inventory** → higher storage and carrying costs.
- **Cash flow strain** due to unsold stock.
- **Missed opportunities** in Q1 & Q2 where capital was tied up in slow-moving goods.
- Need for **predictable demand forecasting** to balance stock levels.

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize Supply Chain**  
   - Implement leaner inventory management.  
   - Adopt real-time tracking and supplier collaboration.  
2. **Enhance Demand Forecasting**  
   - Use AI/ML-driven demand prediction models.  
   - Align production with seasonal demand patterns.  
3. **Strategic Promotions & Discounts**  
   - Clear excess stock in low-performing quarters.  
   - Improve agility in pricing strategies.
